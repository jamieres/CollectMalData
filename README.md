# CollectMalData
CollectMalData is a set of small python scripts that I use to quickly collect information of interest that can be useful during a simple research process.

** "Get Malicious IPs" [getmalips.py] - version 1.0 - for collect malicious IPs from different sources. It create a file called "maliciousip" that you can use with other resources. 
Example: 

** "Get Malicious URLs" [getmalurls.py] - version 1.0 - for collect malicious URLs from different sources. It create a file called "maliciousurl" that you can use with other resources. 

** "Get Malicious Domains" [getmaldomains.py] - version 1.0 - for collect malicious Domains from different sources. It create a file called "maliciousdomain" that you can use with other resources.

** "Get Malicious Emails" [getmalemails.py] - version 1.0 - for collect malicious Emails from different sources. It create a file called "maliciousemail" that you can use with other resources.

You can add anothers sources editing the files.

Usage syntax: just run the scripts :)
